# patchwork

A spritesheet packer for games.

## Overview

This simple utility will pack images into a larger spritesheet, suitable for game development. It
uses the 'maxrects' algorithm as described [here](http://clb.demon.fi/files/RectangleBinPack.pdf).

## Install

```lisp
(ql:quickload :patchwork)
```

## Usage

### Pack Sprites into a Spritesheet

A spritesheet is created from a collection of smaller files. To tell this library which files you
would like packed, you can do this one of three ways:

- Automatically scan for files in the current directory, and add them to a spritesheet:

```lisp
(make-atlas-from-directory "/home/user/sprites"
                           :out-file #p"/tmp/spritesheet.png"
                           :width 1024
                           :height 1024)
```

- Automatically scan for files in the current directory recursively, and add them to a spritesheet:

```lisp
(make-atlas-from-directory "/home/user/sprites"
                           :recursive t
                           :out-file #p"/tmp/spritesheet.png"
                           :width 1024
                           :height 1024)
```

- Manually specify the files to be added to a spritesheet:

To manually add files, you must construct a `file-spec`, which is an association list mapping
absolute pathnames of files to their unique ID. The unique ID is what will be written to the
resulting metadata file. As an example, you can create a list such as:

```lisp
'((#p"/path/to/file1.png" . "bomb")
  (#p"/path/to/file2.png" . "missile"))
```

Once you have a `file-spec`, you can pass it to `MAKE-ATLAS` as follows:

```lisp
(make-atlas file-spec
            :out-file #p"/tmp/spritesheet.png"
            :width 1024
            :height 1024)
```

The above three methods will write an image to disk, as well as a metadata file of the same name
with the extension ".spec". The metadata file is a list of property lists, specifying the ID's of
the images and their positions and sizes in the spritesheet. An example metadata file looks like the
following:

```lisp
((:ID "ship01" :X 1316 :Y 1060 :W 140 :H 140)
 (:ID "ship02" :X 3770 :Y 1944 :W 268 :H 178)
 (:ID "ship03" :X 3502 :Y 1944 :W 268 :H 185)
 (:ID "ship04" :X 2823 :Y 3089 :W 266 :H 118)
 (:ID "ship05" :X 3234 :Y 2134 :W 268 :H 164)
 (:ID "ship06" :X 1751 :Y 3849 :W 268 :H 198)
 (:ID "ship07" :X 1584 :Y 932 :W 140 :H 88)
 (:ID "ship08" :X 3089 :Y 3129 :W 263 :H 168)
 (:ID "ship09" :X 3868 :Y 2886 :W 192 :H 184)
 (:ID "ship10" :X 3600 :Y 2453 :W 147 :H 136)
 (:ID "ship11" :X 3868 :Y 2598 :W 211 :H 146)
 (:ID "ship12" :X 2823 :Y 3207 :W 260 :H 194)
 (:ID "ship13" :X 1189 :Y 1577 :W 130 :H 128)
 (:ID "ship14" :X 3868 :Y 2744 :W 197 :H 142)
 (:ID "ship15" :X 1436 :Y 2113 :W 183 :H 110)
 (:ID "ship16" :X 3083 :Y 3297 :W 137 :H 137))
```

For the first two automatic generation methods above, IDs are automatically generated based on the
filename without the extension, and the path relative to the root directory starting point. This
disambiguates files of the same name located in different directories.

You can also supply the `:normalize` argument to `make-atlas` or `make-atlas-from-directory` to map
pixels to the [0..1] domain when writing the resulting metadata file. This is useful for use with
OpenGL texture coordinates.

You can optionally supply the `:flip-y` argument to `make-atlas` or `make-atlas-from-directory` to
flip the Y axis when writing coordinates to the metadata file. This is useful when using OpenGL
which assumes the origin is at the bottom-left.

Lastly, you can also supply the `:padding` argument to `make-atlas` or `make-atlas-from-directory`
to specify the amount of padding in pixels separating each sprite in the atlas.

### Unpacking Sprites from a Spritesheet

You can perform the reverse operation, and reconstruct the original individual sprite images given a
spritesheet's image and metadata files.

```lisp
(unpack-atlas #p"/tmp/spritesheet.png"
              :out-path #p"/tmp/sprites/")
```

This will unpack all the sprites in `/tmp/spritesheet.png` to the directory `/tmp/sprites/`,
assuming the metadata file `/tmp/spritesheet.spec` exists.
